ALGORITHM
Step1:Take two numbers as input.
Step2:Find the greater of the two numbers.
Step3:Keep on dividing the greater number by the smaller number until remainder becomes 0.
Step4:When the remainder becomes 0 print the smaller number i.e., the denominator as the output.
Step5:Exit

TIME COMPLEXITY
Time Complexity: O(min(a, b))
